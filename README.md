# obscurity

- The sec.py scripts contains a Crypto algo with simple encrypt(text,key) and decrypt(text,key) methods that requires
  a key to encrypt & decrypt a given string .

        usage : ./python3 sec.py -h 
                for help menu !
                
                
- out.txt : ASCII text file .               
- check.txt : ASCII text file feed to `sec.py` to generate `out.txt` with an UNKNOWN key .

 ### > we have to find the KEY used to encrypt check.txt 
 
 My attempt is in the crack2.py
